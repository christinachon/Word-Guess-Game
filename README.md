# Word-Guess-Game

This is my game, The Zelda Word Guessing game. I hope you find it fun!
I have created this game as part of an assignment with the University of Washington Coding Bootcamp.

The game starts automatically when you load the page, just start typing letters to figure out what the mystery word is!
When you win or lose, a new game will automatically begin and it will keep track of your wins and losses. How many wins can you get?
